# Midterm App: Random Number Guesser

This application is a game where different players can guess a random number between 1-100 and then be shown on a High Score board.

## Functionality 

The following **required** functionality is completed:

*Followed the layout criteria listed in the assignment page
*Game code is implemented 
*High score code is implemented
*Communcation between fragments and the database is implemented
*Toasts and sounds are included within the code
*+ and - is implemented inside of the code
*Uses all required items
*Follows instructions listed inside of assignment page as closely as possible. Some features are not 100% fully implemented but are atleast present for review.

## Video Walkthrough

*App opens to main screen, but encounters crashes when trying to access the different fragments at certain times. A video of the app would basically just show the app crashing. 

## Notes

While I understood a lot of the concepts that I did within this project, it is tough with the scale of it to get it completely debugged and 100% working by the deadline. I definitely learned a lot more through this development process than last weeks Notes app. 
There are a few implementations that aren't fully functional so I commented them out. I'm not sure if that constitutes any partial points or anything like that (I'd imagine not) but I am atleast happy that I got to write some code for those implementations.
